# Welcome
There is an organization made to help Linux beginners start, Here you will find most of the repositories that you will need.
our official webpage: https://aroa-dev.github.io/

Keep in mind that this is by no means a professional cybersecurity team nor an expert team on any of the topics. We are also Beginners and are also trying to expand our college and are trying to build a community that will also do so by contributing their salvage in educated discussions.

Some Rules Have To be followed

1.We will allow any kind of knowledge, except if this is expressed not to help people but to harm them.

2.The discusion must be respectfull and help full

3.If you modify any of the repositries from other creators please folow the licenses
